    <div class="about-subheading">Why We Started</div>
    <img src="{% static 'Images/about-3.png' %}" alt="Why We Started">
    <p class="about-highlight">Our journey began with a simple belief: pets are family.</p>
    <p>
      What started as a humble dream grew from a need we saw in our own community—a lack of reliable, affordable, and compassionate pet care. Inspired by our own rescue dog, we set out to build a place where pets are treated like royalty, and their humans are supported every step of the way.
   
      It all began when we couldn’t find a trusted local store that combined quality with compassion. Most places felt cold and transactional—not the kind of experience pet parents deserved. So we envisioned a shop that would feel warm, welcoming, and full of heart.
  
      Since then, we’ve grown from a tiny room stacked with supplies to a full-fledged pet shop serving hundreds of families. Along the way, we’ve hosted adoption drives, supported rescue shelters, and celebrated countless “gotcha days” with proud pet parents.
   
      Every day, we wake up grateful for the opportunity to serve our furry customers. Little Heart Pet Shop exists because of love—love for animals, love for community, and love for the little moments that make pet parenthood special.
